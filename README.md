The only difference between them is the wait cursor. &nbsp; I designed these to be used with a dark theme.<br>
Some of the wait cursors can be seen here.

Extract the tar file into ~/.icons folder for personal use.
Or /usr/share/icons for global use.
<BR><br>To show the thumbnail properly in the settings->themes app, the thumbnail.png in any theme should be copied into /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/cursors folder while renaming it as the theme name.<br><br>
Example:  If using <b>Bounce</b> then the command would look like this:<br>
sudo cp ~/.icons/Bounce/thumbnail.png /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/cursors/Bounce.png

These can be used in KDE also.  The sizes are 24px 32px and 48px.
<br><br>My favorites are the Gear, Gear-Orange, and Spinner.<br>One of the more difficult ones I created is the Metronome. &nbsp; Getting the swinging pendulum was fun.
