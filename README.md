Cursors

![](sample.png)

This is a collection of 3 cursor themes.
The only difference between the 3 is the wait cursor.

The tree cursors can be seen in the sample above, bottom left corner. 
AKcursors.blk, AKcursors.hour and AKcursors.spinner.

Copy any one of these into your ~/.icons folder for personal use.
Or /usr/share/icons for global use.

To make settings->themes show the thumbnail properly the thumbnails must be copied into /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/cursors folder.
If using AKcursors.blk then the command would look like this:

sudo cp ~/.icons/AKcursors.blk/thumbnail.png /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/cursors/AKcursors.blk.png
