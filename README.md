Cursors
![](sample.png)
This is a collection of 3 cursor themes.
The only difference between the 3 is the wait cursor.

AKcursors.blk has a rotating set of dots starting with white down to black.
AKcursors.hour has a rotating hourglass.
AKcursors.spinner has a rotating elongated dots much like AKcursors.blk

Copy any one of these into your ~/.icons folder for personal use.
Or /usr/share/icons for global use.
