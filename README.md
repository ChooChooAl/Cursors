This is a collection of cursor themes that I've been creating.

The only difference between them is the wait cursor. I designed these to be used on dark themes.  Some can be used in light themes.<br>
Some of the wait cursors can be seen here.

Copy any one of these folders into your ~/.icons folder for personal use.
Or /usr/share/icons for global use.

To use them, goto settings->themes <BR><br>To show the thumbnail properly in the settings-themes app, the thumbnail.png must be copied into /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/cursors folder and renaming it.<br>
Example:  If using Bounce then the command would look like this:<br>
sudo cp ~/.icons/Bounce/thumbnail.png /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/cursors/Bounce.png

These can be used in KDE also.  The sizes are 24px 32px and 48px.
